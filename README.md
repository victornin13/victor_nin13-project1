The blue dots are mice, the yellow/cyan dots are cats, and the red/black zombie-cats. 
Cats chase mice, and when they catch a mouse, they eat it. If a cat doesnâ€™t eat enough, they turn into a zombie-cat.
Zombie-cats chase mice and other cats. They can eat a mouse, but if they eat a cat, that cat turns into a zombie-cat!
